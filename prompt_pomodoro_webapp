## Prompt Text

You are an expert front-end developer. Build a single-page web application (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only, no backend) with the following features and design requirements:

---

### Core Features
1. **Pomodoro Timer**
   - Default: 25 minutes work, 5 minutes break.  
   - Adjustable session lengths.  
   - Start, pause, reset controls.  
   - Animated circular speedometer-style progress indicator (inspired by motorcycle speedometers, but futuristic and minimal).  

2. **Task Tracker (To-Do List)**  
   - Add, mark as complete, delete tasks.  
   - Persist data in localStorage so tasks remain after page reload.  
   - Clean task management UI.  

3. **Focus Music Player**  
   - Built-in playlist of royalty-free focus music playable directly in the browser (use accessible direct audio links or base64-embedded tracks so no upload is required).  
   - Controls: play, pause, next track, volume.  
   - Runs in the background while using the timer or tasks.  

---

### Design & UI Requirements
- Color theme: dominated by a futuristic blue primary palette with gradients.  
- Style: 3D neumorphism / glassmorphism hybrid (soft shadows, glowing highlights, futuristic depth).  
- Main visual element: timer should look like a motorcycle speedometer, but sleek, digital, and sci-fi-inspired.  
- Smooth transitions and hover effects.  
- Futuristic typography and glowing UI highlights.  
- Responsive layout: works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.  

---

### Technical Guidelines
- Use only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).  
- Everything must be inside a single-page structure (`index.html` with embedded or linked CSS/JS).  
- Code must be clean, modular, and well-commented.  
- Store tasks and user preferences (last timer values, current track, volume) in localStorage.  
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility.  
- Animations must be GPU-friendly and smooth.  

---

### Deliverables
- Provide the complete code in copy-paste-ready format.  
- The app must be fully functional immediately in the browser (no extra setup).  
- Do not skip any requested features: timer, futuristic speedometer-style UI, to-do list with localStorage, focus music player, responsive design, 3D effects.
