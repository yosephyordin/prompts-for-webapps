You are an expert full-stack developer and UI/UX designer.
Build a single-page web app called Atlas Mind using React, HTML, and CSS only (no backend yet).

GOAL:
Create a next-generation Mind Mapping + Whiteboard hybrid tool that allows users to visualize ideas, connect nodes, draw freely, and attach evidence (sources, PDFs, links, etc.), all inside a single interactive canvas.

CORE REQUIREMENTS:

Use React for components and state management.

Use HTML5 Canvas or SVG for drawing and node linking.

Use pure CSS (or Tailwind if preferred) for styling.

Everything should work inside one single page (index.html).

Allow export as PNG or PDF of the current canvas view.

MAIN FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

Infinite Smart Canvas

A zoomable, draggable infinite canvas (like Miro or Figma whiteboard).

Smooth panning and zooming interactions using mouse or trackpad.

Nodes (Mind Map Elements)

Users can create, drag, and connect nodes with lines or curves.

Nodes should have editable titles and optional color tags.

Clicking a node highlights its connections.

Option to collapse or expand branches.

Whiteboard / Free Draw Mode

Toggle “Draw Mode” to freely sketch or annotate on the canvas.

Support basic pen, eraser, color picker, and stroke thickness.

Drawings should stay on the canvas and be included in export.

Evidence Node System
Each node can contain attached “Evidence” items:

URL links (displayed as clickable)

Image uploads (display thumbnail)

PDF uploads (preview icon or filename)

Short notes or quotes

Optional embedded YouTube videos (if possible with thumbnail)

Use a small icon on the node to open a popup showing these attachments.

Hybrid Layout Modes

Mind Map Mode → Auto-arrange nodes in a tree layout.

Whiteboard Mode → Freely position nodes anywhere.

Mixed Mode → Retain lines but allow manual repositioning.

Export Features

Export as PNG → capture the visible canvas (nodes and drawings).

Export as PDF → using client-side libraries (like html2canvas and jsPDF).

Extra Smart Touches (Optional but Powerful)

AI Snap: when the user draws shapes (like circles or boxes), auto-smooth them.

Quick Research Drop: when the user pastes a URL, auto-fetch its title and image preview.

Highlight nodes that have the most attached evidence (for example, “Most Grounded Idea” badge).

Stylus-ready handwriting mode for tablets.

DESIGN STYLE

Clean, minimal, and futuristic UI.

Soft shadows, rounded corners (radius 2xl).

Light color palette (white background with subtle pastels).

Floating toolbar for quick actions (Add Node, Draw Mode, Export, etc.).

Smooth transitions using Framer Motion if available.

FINAL EXPECTATION

The app should open directly in the browser (no backend or login needed).

Users can instantly:

Add and connect nodes.

Draw freely on the canvas.

Attach evidence files to each node.

Export their current mind map and drawings as PDF or PNG.

Focus on making it beautiful, fluid, and creative, something that feels like Miro and Notion.
