Create a simple web-based single-page game inspired by "Pong Wars" with a relaxing twist. Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (you can use a lightweight JS game/animation framework like p5.js, Phaser, or Three.js). Keep all code in a single project.
Game description:
* The screen is divided into two sides: left (player) and right (enemy). Each side has a grid of colored blocks (blue for player, red for enemy).
* Multiple colored ping pong balls automatically bounce around the arena. When a ball hits a block, it slowly damages and destroys the block.
* Balls from the enemy side also attack the playerâ€™s blocks. The battle plays out automatically with no controls needed.
* Visual style should be minimal but colorful, with smooth animations.
* Sound: add built-in relaxing background music (chill/lo-fi style) and soft ping/pong sound effects when balls bounce or hit blocks.
Extra features:
* Blocks crack or fade before breaking for visual feedback.
* Optionally add simple upgrades: faster ball speed, split balls, or stronger blocks.
* The vibe should be relaxing and fun to watch, not stressful.
Technical requirements:
* Responsive design, playable on desktop and mobile browsers.
* Smooth GPU-friendly animations.
* No backend needed, everything runs client-side.
