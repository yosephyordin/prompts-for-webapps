I want you to create a complete code in a single HTML file (index.html) for a **Simple Kanban Board** that runs entirely on the client-side (frontend), without any backend, using only **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

### ðŸ”¹ Core Requirements:
- Store all data (columns, cards, order, etc.) in `localStorage`.
- No server or external database.
- Everything must be contained within a single `index.html` file.

### ðŸ”¹ Core Features:
1. **Fixed Columns**: At least 3 default columns: "To Do", "In Progress", "Done".
2. **Task Cards**:
   - Can be added within each column.
   - Can be edited inline directly on the card.
   - Can be deleted.
   - Display the creation date (use `new Date()`).
3. **Drag & Drop**:
   - Cards can be dragged and dropped between columns.
   - Use HTML5 Drag and Drop API or a manual implementation.
4. **Automatic Saving**:
   - Any changes (add, edit, delete, move) are saved instantly to `localStorage`.
   - Data is restored from `localStorage` upon page reload.

### ðŸ”¹ Additional Features (Must Be Included):
1. **Luxurious Design**: Use a **black and gold** color scheme (like elegant gold), with a dark and sophisticated theme.
2. **Entrance Animations**: Use subtle `fadeIn` or transition animations when cards and columns appear.
3. **Responsive Design**: The layout must be clean and usable on smartphone screens (mobile-first or responsive).
4. **Creation Date on Cards**: Displayed below the card content.
5. **Inline Editing**: Cards can be edited directly without a separate form.
6. **Reset Board Button**: To clear all data stored in `localStorage`.
7. **Hover Effects**: Cards slightly lift and gain a stronger shadow on hover.
8. **Delete Card**: Use a symbol (e.g., &times;) in the top-right corner of the card.

### ðŸ”¹ Sample Data Structure in localStorage:
{
  "columns": {
    "todo": { "id": "todo", "title": "To Do", "cardIds": ["card-1"] },
    "progress": { "id": "progress", "title": "In Progress", "cardIds": [] },
    "done": { "id": "done", "title": "Done", "cardIds": [] }
  },
  "cards": {
    "card-1": { "id": "card-1", "content": "Example task", "date": "06/10/2025" }
  },
  "columnOrder": ["todo", "progress", "done"],
  "nextCardId": 2
}

### ðŸ”¹ Style and User Experience:
- Clean, elegant, and modern design.
- Visually comfortable layout with appropriate contrast.
- Responsive: Columns stack vertically on smaller screens.
- Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout.
- Subtle entrance animations for cards and columns on initial load.

Please provide the **complete, functional, and ready-to-use** code. Ensure the layout remains visually appealing and fully functional when accessed on smartphones.
