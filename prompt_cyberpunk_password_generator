You are an expert front-end developer. Build a **single-page web application (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only, no backend)** with the following requirements:
**Core Features**
1. **Random Password Generator**
    ◦ Users can generate strong random passwords with customizable options (length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
    ◦ The generation process should **animate like an old suitcase/dial lock** where characters spin randomly before stopping on the final password.
    ◦ Provide copy-to-clipboard functionality.
2. **UI/Design Requirements**
    ◦ **Dominant color theme:** black background with subtle neon or metallic highlights (cyberpunk + retro mechanical vibe).
    ◦ **3D-inspired design**: elements should look like physical mechanical dials/buttons, with depth, shadows, and glowing edges.
    ◦ Password display area should feel like a **rotating slot machine or old lock mechanism**, with smooth rolling animation before revealing the final password.
    ◦ Buttons styled like **3D mechanical switches**.
    ◦ Smooth hover/press interactions.
    ◦ **Responsive design**: works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
3. **Animations**
    ◦ Each password generation should visually simulate **random spinning characters** for a few seconds before settling.
    ◦ Subtle glowing effects or sparks when the password is revealed, to enhance the “futuristic mechanical” feel.
**Technical Guidelines**
• Use only **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.
• Keep everything in a **single-page structure** (index.html with linked/embedded CSS & JS).
• Code must be **clean, modular, and well-commented**.
• Ensure animations are smooth and GPU-friendly.
• Provide full functionality without backend (standalone in the browser).
**Deliverables**
• Provide the **complete, copy-paste ready code**.
• The app must be **fully functional immediately in the browser**.
• Do not skip requested features: random password generator, suitcase/dial-style animation, black futuristic theme, 3D UI elements, responsive design.
⚡ With this prompt, generate a **futuristic yet retro-mechanical password generator** that feels like spinning an old lock but reveals a modern strong password.
