Create a single-page, hyper-immersive landing page for "Alcheboard"‚Äîa premium board game store‚Äîusing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The experience must feel "4D": not just visual, but spatially aware, contextually responsive, and emotionally engaging, as if the user has stepped into a living board game universe.

üîÆ Core 4D Experience Requirements:
1. Hypercontextual Scroll-Driven 4D Dice:

A 3D-rendered dice (using Three.js) must float persistently in the bottom-right corner of the viewport.
While scrolling:
The dice scales up (e.g., from 40px to 80px), becomes more detailed, and orbits slightly around the user‚Äôs scroll direction (e.g., tilts forward when scrolling down, backward when up).
It emits subtle particle sparks (use lightweight canvas or Three.js particles) on rapid scroll.
When scrolling stops:
The dice smoothly minimizes back to a compact, idle state (e.g., gently rotating in place).
Its opacity slightly reduces to avoid distraction.
The dice must never obstruct content‚Äîuse pointer-events: none and smart positioning.
2. Immersive 4D Section Transitions (Hypercontextual):

Each major section (Hero ‚Üí Games ‚Üí About ‚Üí Testimonials ‚Üí Contact) should feel like entering a new game realm.
Use GSAP + ScrollTrigger + custom shaders or 3D transforms to create transitions that respond to scroll velocity and direction:
Example: Scrolling from Hero to Games triggers a ‚Äúboard unfolding‚Äù effect‚Äîwooden panels slide open in 3D space, revealing game cards beneath.
Scrolling into About triggers a ‚Äúpotion swirl‚Äù (alchemical theme): golden particles coalesce into text, with depth layers shifting like a diorama.
Transitions must be context-aware: faster scroll = more dramatic effect; slow scroll = subtle, elegant reveal.
3. Spatial Depth & Environmental Storytelling:

Use multi-layer parallax (at least 3 depth layers: background, midground, foreground) to simulate a physical game table environment.
Background: distant shelves with faint glowing game boxes.
Midground: floating cards, tokens, or rulebooks that drift slowly.
Foreground: interactive elements (buttons, dice, cards) with realistic shadows and depth.
Ambient sound design (optional but encouraged): subtle dice rolls or parchment rustles on scroll (use Web Audio API with user-gesture activation).
üß© Page Structure & Content:
1. Hero Section

Headline: "Alcheboard: Where Strategy Meets Sorcery"
Subtitle: "Curated board games that transform your table into a realm of adventure."
CTA: "Begin Your Quest"
Animated background: A 3D game board assembles in real-time (pieces slide in from edges using GSAP).
2. Featured Games

4 interactive game cards in a responsive grid.
On scroll entry: cards rise from the ‚Äútable surface‚Äù with staggered bounce.
On hover: card flips to reveal gameplay details; emits a soft golden glow.
3. About Alcheboard

Narrative: "Forged in the spirit of alchemy, we blend timeless gameplay with modern design."
Animated alchemical symbols pulse gently in the background (SVG + CSS keyframes).
4. Testimonials

Quotes appear as if written on parchment scrolls that unroll on scroll.
5. Contact & Newsletter

Email input with a ‚Äúseal stamp‚Äù animation on submit.
The 4D dice reacts to form interaction (e.g., rolls a ‚Äú6‚Äù on successful submit).
üé® Design & Technical Specs:
Color Palette: Antique gold, mahogany, forest green, parchment white, deep navy.
Typography: Serif (e.g., Cinzel or Playfair Display) for headings; readable sans-serif (Inter) for body.
Libraries:
Three.js (for the 4D dice + optional 3D elements)
GSAP + ScrollTrigger + Flip plugin (for scroll animations & transitions)
Optional: lil-gui for debug, but remove in final build
Performance:
Dice animation must be GPU-accelerated.
Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth scroll-follow logic.
All assets optimized; lazy-load non-critical visuals.
Responsive: Fully functional on mobile (dice scales down; transitions simplify but remain magical).
üåå Final Goal:
The user should feel like they‚Äôre not browsing a website‚Äîbut playing a living board game. Every scroll, click, and pause should trigger contextual, emotionally resonant feedback that deepens immersion. The 4D dice acts as a companion spirit, reacting to the user‚Äôs journey through the page.
